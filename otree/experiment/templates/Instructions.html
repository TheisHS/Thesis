<h1>Experiment Instructions</h1>

<p>Welcome to the experiment. Please read the instructions carefully.</p>

<p>
  In this experiment, you will be asked to complete two programming tasks. You
  have 20 minutes to solve each of the tasks. Before each task, we will measure
  a baseline condition, by having you relax while looking at a blank screen for
  30 seconds.
</p>

<p>
  After that, you will be shown the task description, which consists of both
  images and text. You will have 2 minutes to read the task description, but it
  will also be available while solving the task. Make sure to read the
  description well.
</p>

<p>
  The programming tasks should be solved in Java. If there is anything in the
  task description that you do not understand, implement it to the best of your
  ability. You will not be evaluated on the correctness, quality or performance
  of your solution.
</p>

<p>
  The pages will automatically change after this one. Feel free to click
  continue when you are ready!
