<h1>Experiment Instructions</h1>

<p>Welcome to the experiment. Please read the instructions carefully.</p>

<p>
  In this experiment, you will be asked to complete two programming tasks. You
  have 20 minutes to solve each of the tasks. Before each task, we will measure
  a baseline condition, by having you fixate on a cross in the middle of the
  screen for 30 seconds.
</p>

<p>
  After this, you will be shown the task description, which consists of both
  images and text. You will have 3 mintes to read the task description, but it
  will also be available while solving the task. Make sure to read the
  description well.
</p>

<p>
  The programming tasks should to be solved in Java. If there is anything in the
  task description that you do not understand, implement it to the best of your
  ability. There will be tests that you can run for your code, if you wish to
  check if it works, but you will not be evaluated on the correctness, quality
  or performance of your solution. If the tests fail, make sure you have named
  each class and method as described in the task description.
</p>

<p>
  When solving the task, the screen will be split in two. On the left side, you
  will have access to Visual Studio Code. Some of the files necessary to solve
  the task will be provided by us and should not be edited. On the right side of
  the screen, you will either have access to the LLM ChatGPT 4o-mini, or to a
  browser window, starting Google's frontpage. It will be clear from the task
  description, which of the two will be available. If you have access to the web
  browser, you are not allowed to access any AI-tools. Doing so will make your
  participation invalid.
