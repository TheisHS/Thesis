<h1>Experiment Instructions</h1>

<p>Welcome to the experiment. Please read the instructions carefully.</p>

<p>
  In this experiment, you will be asked to complete two programming tasks. You
  have 20 minutes to solve each of the tasks. Before each task, you will be
  asked to watch a 2 minute calming fish-tank video. When the video plays,
  please sit still, focus on the video and relax.
</p>

<p>
  After the video, you will be shown the task description. This will be shown
  for 3 minutes. The task description consists of both images and text. Make
  sure to read the description well. You can always see the images while solving
  the task.
</p>

<p>
  The programming tasks are supposed to be solved in Java. If there is anything
  in the task description that you do not understand, implement it to the best
  of your ability. There will be tests that you can run for your code, if you
  wish to check if it works, but you will not be evaluated on the correctness,
  quality or performance of your solution.
</p>

<p>
  When solving the task, the screen will be split in two. On the left side, you
  will have access to Visual Studio Code, containing some starting code. On the
  right side of the screen, you will either have access to the LLM ChatGPT, or
  to a browser window, starting Google's frontpage. It will be clear from the
  task description, which of the two will be available. If you have access to
  the web browser, you are not allowed to access any AI-tools. Doing so will
  make your participation invalid.
